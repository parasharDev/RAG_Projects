Rahman.This place felt like home, helped me meet like-minded musicians, and for the first time, made me feel like I was finally around people like me.This here is a core memory from KM.\\xa0Almost every day looked like this,Musicians breaking into random, impromptu jams in the common hallway.\\xa0We spent so much time here, the security guards had to literally push us out every evening\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    The Story Of My First Electric Guitar\\nIt was the summer of 2010. I had just finished my 10th boards, and my brother had come home from college. One evening, casually, he asked me, “Hey, my friend has an electric guitar and an amp lying around… do you want it?”I froze.He said it was a Fender. My jaw dropped. A Fender?! I couldn’t believe it. Of course, it turned out to be a Squier, not a Fender but to me, that didn’t matter. That was my first ever electric guitar. I still remember holding it for the first time, plugging it in, and feeling like I had just unlocked a whole new world.That one moment changed the direction of my life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWrite your awesome label here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    over the years\\n\\n    The Guitar took me places.\\nWhat started as random riffs in my room slowly turned into something bigger. That first electric guitar took me places, literally. I found myself studying music at KM Music Conservatory in Chennai, and even walked the halls of Berklee College of Music during a summer program. Every step, every place, every photo here was because of that one spark.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKM Music Conservatory - 2014\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBerklee College Of Music -

Rahman.This place felt like home, helped me meet like-minded musicians, and for the first time, made me feel like I was finally around people like me.This here is a core memory from KM.\\xa0Almost every day looked like this,Musicians breaking into random, impromptu jams in the common hallway.\\xa0We spent so much time here, the security guards had to literally push us out every evening\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    The Story Of My First Electric Guitar\\nIt was the summer of 2010. I had just finished my 10th boards, and my brother had come home from college. One evening, casually, he asked me, “Hey, my friend has an electric guitar and an amp lying around… do you want it?”I froze.He said it was a Fender. My jaw dropped. A Fender?! I couldn’t believe it. Of course, it turned out to be a Squier, not a Fender but to me, that didn’t matter. That was my first ever electric guitar. I still remember holding it for the first time, plugging it in, and feeling like I had just unlocked a whole new world.That one moment changed the direction of my life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWrite your awesome label here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    over the years\\n\\n    The Guitar took me places.\\nWhat started as random riffs in my room slowly turned into something bigger.
